# Arabic Dialect Classification with Synthetic Data and Semi-Supervised Learning

## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) faces significant challenges with data scarcity, especially for languages like Arabic. The unique dialectal diversity and informal usage of Arabic in texts and social media make it difficult to access large, labeled datasets. Privacy concerns and labeling challenges further exacerbate this problem. This research addresses these challenges by leveraging **synthetic data** and a **semi-supervised learning (SSL)** approach.

## Objectives
This project investigates the impact of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) on Arabic dialect classification. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Address the **data shortage** using LLM-generated synthetic data.
2. Overcome the **label shortage** using SSL to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of combining synthetic and real data in improving model performance.

## Research Focus
We focus on classifying five Arabic dialects from the **MADAR dataset** using three main experiments:
1. **Real Data + SSL**: Evaluate the performance of SSL with only real data.
2. **Real + Synthetic Data + SSL**: Combine real data with LLM-generated synthetic data in SSL and test on real data.
3. **Synthetic Data + SSL**: Test SSL using only synthetic data to assess its potential as a substitute for real data.

## Contributions
- **Sondos**: 
  - Extracted and analyzed a subset of the MADAR dataset.
  - Focused on embedding-based semantic similarity of real and LLM-generated data.
  - Applied preprocessing techniques and evaluated their impact on model performance.
- **Mena**: 
  - Designed prompt engineering strategies for generating synthetic data using LLMs.
  - Creation of 2 synthetic datasets using GPT4o and GPT4o mini
- **Mariam**: 
  - Implemented the self-training and supervision pipeline.
  - Conducted variations in experimental setups and performed comparative analysis.

## Significance
This research provides insights into:
- The potential of LLM-generated synthetic data to address data shortages in low-resource languages.
- The effectiveness of SSL in handling limited labeled data.
- The feasibility of using synthetic data as a complete or partial substitute for real data.
